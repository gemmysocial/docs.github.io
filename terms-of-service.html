    <title>Gems Terms of Service</title>
</head>
<body>

<p><strong>Last Updated: January 25, 2025</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to Gems, a social networking application! We're excited to have you on board as a user.
Gems runs on the AT Protocol ("AT Protocol"), a decentralized social networking protocol that
supports many different kinds of services. These Terms of Service apply to the Gems service.</p>

<p>Before you dive into using Gems, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms. This document
outlines our legal obligations to each other and they apply to your use of our services.</p>

<p>Gems is available at gems.xyz (the “Site”). Your use of Gems is subject to these Terms of Service
(“Terms”), as well as Gems Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>These terms only apply to social networking that happens on the Gems application. If you’re using
another social networking application on the AT Protocol that isn’t Gems (we call this a “Developer
Application”), the developers of the other service will provide the terms and conditions that govern your
experience.</p>

<p>When we say “Gems,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these Terms, we mean Gemmy Tech Inc..</p>

<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> These Terms contain an agreement to resolve most disputes between us through
arbitration (instead of suing in court) and to waive jury trials and class actions. Please read Sections 14
and 15 carefully.</p>

<p><em>In some cases below, we’ve added some summary text in italics to make these Terms easier to navigate,
but please remember that the full text of these Terms is the most important.</em></p>

<h2>1. Who Can Use Gems?</h2>

<p><strong>a. Eligibility.</strong> To use Gems, you must be at least 18 years old and legally permitted to use
Gems based on the laws in your country. If you are not yet an adult according to the laws of your country,
your parent or legal guardian must read these Terms on your behalf. If you’re a parent or legal guardian,
and you allow your child (who meets the minimum age for your country) to use the services, then these
terms also apply to you, and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.</p>

<p><strong>b. Accounts.</strong> To use Gems, you must create an account (“Account”). Don’t share your
Account with others, because you’re responsible for all activities under your Account, whether or not
you know about them. If you’re using Gems on behalf of a company or organization, you confirm that you
have the authority to represent your company or organization. If you believe your Account created
through Gems has been compromised, report it to us at <a href="mailto:support@gems.xyz">support@gems.xyz</a>.</p>

<h2>2. User Content.</h2>

<p><strong>a. User Content.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b.</strong> “User Content” means any type of content you make available on Gems (“Content”), such as
your posts, profile, photos, or links.</p>

<p><strong>c. Your Responsibility for User Content.</strong> You, not Gems, are solely responsible for all of
your User Content. Gems does not control any of your content, including others’ use of your content.</p>

<p><strong>Gems’s Responsibility for User Content:</strong> User Content is only used only in connection with:
(1) providing Gems and Content, including by sharing User Content throughout Gems and the AT Protocol
as well as developing and improving our current and future offerings; and (2) promoting and marketing
Gems and Gemmy Tech Inc.</p>

<p><strong>d. Gems’s Permission to Use Your User Content.</strong> You keep your ownership of User Content,
subject to the license below. Gems does not own rights to your User Content. By sharing User Content
through Gems, you grant us permission to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>i.</strong> Use User Content to develop, provide, and improve Gems, the AT Protocol, and any
        of our future offerings. For example, we can store and present User Content to other users in
        Gems. This allows us to show your posts in the Gems app to other users.</li>
    <li><strong>ii.</strong> Modify or otherwise utilize User Content in any media. For example, we can resize
        your posts to fit the Gems mobile or desktop app, or feature examples of User Content for
        promotional purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>iii.</strong> Grant others the right to take the actions above. For example, we can grant content
        moderation tools access to User Content in order to monitor Gems.</li>
    <li><strong>iv.</strong> Remove or modify User Content for any reason, including User Content that we
        believe violates these Terms or other policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The license is limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, and royalty-free.</p>

<p><strong>e. Removal of User Content:</strong> If you delete your account we will use reasonable efforts to
remove it from Gems, subject to any requirements under applicable law and the
<a href="https://gems.xyz/privacy">Gems Privacy Policy</a>. If users have generated User Content on
other services provided by the AT Protocol, Gems will make all reasonable efforts to remove it, but
given the design of the open network it is not guaranteed that Gems will be able to do so
comprehensively.</p>

<h2>3. General Prohibitions and Enforcement.</h2>

<p><strong>a. General Prohibitions.</strong> We encourage you to report violations of these Terms or the Gems
Privacy Policy by using in-app reporting features or the in-app feedback form.</p>

<h2>4. Termination.</h2>

<p><strong>a. Your Right to Termination:</strong> If you want to delete your Account, you can do so through your
account settings. If your account was terminated by Gems, we retain the right to keep a copy of your
data for trust and safety purposes. These Terms will survive termination of your Account.</p>

<p><strong>b. Our Right to Termination:</strong> We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account
and/or specific services offered within Gems without notice, at our discretion, for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>i.</strong> We believe you’ve violated these Terms or the Gems Privacy Policy.</li>
    <li><strong>ii.</strong> We’re required to do so due to a court order, legal requirement, or regulatory
        requirement.</li>
    <li><strong>iii.</strong> Continuing to allow your account to be active, giving you access to some or all
        services, or hosting your content creates risk for Gems, other users, or third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Appeals.</h2>

<p>You can appeal any enforcement decision from these Terms, including suspension or termination,
by emailing <a href="mailto:support@gems.xyz">support@gems.xyz</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Terms Required by the App Store and Google Play.</h2>

<p>The App Store and Google Play require us to pass on certain terms to you. The following terms
apply if you access or download the Gems App through the App Store or Google Play (each, an
“App Provider”):</p>
<ul>
    <li>These Terms are between you and Gems, and not with the App Provider, and Gems is
        solely responsible for the Gems App.</li>
    <li>Gems is responsible for any other claims, losses, damages, or expenses if the Gems App
        fails to conform to any warranty. You may notify the App Provider and, to the maximum
        extent permitted by law, the App Provider will have no other warranty obligation with
        respect to the Gems App. The App Provider is not required to provide any maintenance
        and support for the Gems App.</li>
    <li>The App Provider is not responsible for addressing your claims or any third-party claims
        relating to the Gems App.</li>
    <li>If any third party claims that the Gems App or your possession and use of it infringes that
        third party’s intellectual property rights, Gems will be solely responsible for that claim to
        the extent required by these Terms.</li>
    <li>The App Provider and its subsidiaries have the right to enforce these Terms as third-party
        beneficiaries of these Terms.</li>
    <li>You must follow all applicable third-party terms of service when using the Gems App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Open Source.</h2>

<p>Some of Gems is subject to an open source license agreement. Your use of those parts of Gems will be
governed by such open source licenses to the extent that the license explicitly overrides these Terms (for
example, if the license grants broader use rights).</p>

<h2>8. [RESERVED]</h2>

<h2>9. Links to Third Party Websites or Resources.</h2>

<p>Gems allows you to access third-party websites or other resources. The use of any third-party services
is at your own risk, and Gems isn’t responsible for any third-party services or content available
through them.</p>

<h2>10. Updates.</h2>

<p>We update our terms from time to time, and will either post the updated Terms or send other
communications to let you know about any changes. If you keep using Gems, you agree to the updated
Terms. If you don’t agree, you must stop using Gems.</p>

<h2>11. Warranty Disclaimers.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: We work hard to offer great services, but there are certain aspects that we can’t
guarantee.</em></p>

<p>Our Services and all included content are provided on an "as is" basis without warranty of any
kind, whether express or implied. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE DISCLAIM
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF
COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT GEMS
WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED,
SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS.</p>

<p>Gems takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other
user or third party posts or transmits using our Services. You understand and agree that you may
be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, unreliable, untrue, untimely, incomplete,
objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.</p>

<p><strong>THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</strong> Gems does not disclaim any warranty or
other right that we are prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.</p>

<h2>12. Indemnity.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: If someone brings a legal claim against us based on your actions on Gems, you are
responsible for our defense in, and the consequences of, that claim.</em></p>

<p>You will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Gems and its affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, and agents ("Gems Parties”), from and against any claims,
disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, and costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees arising out of or in any way connected with (a)
your access to or use of Gems, (b) your User Content, or (c) your violation of these Terms. Gems
may assume the exclusive control and defense of any matter for which you have a duty to
indemnify Gems and, if we do, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.</p>

<h2>13. Limitation of Liability.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: This section limits what you can recover from us in a dispute to any direct damages
that you suffer up to $100. This doesn’t apply where it would be illegal to do so.</em></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE GEMS PARTIES WILL
        NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST
        REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA
        OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE
        DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF
        ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR
        FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE GEMS OR FOR ANY ERROR OR
        DEFECT IN GEMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
        THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT GEMS OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED
        REMEDY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS
        ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GEMS SHALL NOT BE
        RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR CONTENT OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE,
        OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY’S
        CONTENT (INCLUDING ANY USER CONTENT), WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
        CONTENT IS ACCESSED THROUGH GEMS, AND THAT ANY RISK OF HARM
        OR DAMAGE FROM THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
        WILL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF THE GEMS PARTIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
        CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO
        USE GEMS EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</strong></li>
    <li><strong>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
        FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN
        GEMS AND YOU.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>14. Governing Law, Forum Choice and Class Action Waiver.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: All disputes you have with us will be resolved by binding arbitration where permitted.
If we need to go to court, it will be in Delaware under Delaware law. You agree not to participate
in a class-action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration against us.</em></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be
        governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State
        of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly
        set forth in Section 15 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes
        (defined below) that you and Gems are not required to arbitrate will be the state and
        federal courts located in Delaware, and you and Gems each waive any objection to
        jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</li>
    <li><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> YOU AND GEMS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS
        AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
        NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through
        arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims,
        and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If
        this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of Section 15
        “Dispute Resolution” shall be null and void.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15. Dispute Resolution.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: If there is a dispute between us, with limited exceptions, we’ll resolve it through
arbitration. Note that this section does not apply to users who live in the E.U. or any place where
arbitration is not permitted.</em></p>

<p><strong>a. Informal Resolution.</strong> Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue
with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
You can do this by sending us a written description of the dispute, including your name,
an email or a phone number for us to contact you, your Gems account, the nature of the
complaint, and how you would like to resolve it, to <a href="mailto:support@gems.xyz">support@gems.xyz</a>. If the dispute is
not resolved within sixty (60) days after we receive your written notice, we agree to
proceed with further dispute resolution as outlined below. Attempting an informal
resolution process is required before starting any formal dispute resolution. During this
process, any applicable statutes of limitations and deadlines for arbitration filing fees or
other requirements will be put on hold.</p>

<p><strong>b. Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</strong> After the parties have engaged in a good-faith, but
unsuccessful, effort to resolve the dispute in accordance with the “informal resolution”
process (above), you and Gems agree to resolve any dispute, disagreement, or claim
relating to these terms or our services through final and binding individual
arbitration. Arbitration will not be in a class, representative or consolidated action or
proceeding. You and Gems agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Gems are each waiving
the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision
shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>c. Exceptions.</strong> As limited exceptions to Section 15(b) above: (i) we both may seek to
resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to
seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p>

<p><strong>d. Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules.</strong></p>

<p><em>Summary: The American Arbitration Association’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will
apply. You may be able to choose the types of evidence you and we can submit depending
on the size of your claim. Arbitration will be near where you live unless we agree
otherwise.</em></p>

<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as
modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling
1-800-778-7879. If you want to start arbitration, you must submit a written Demand for
Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The
AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>

<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless
we both agree to a different location. Both parties agree that the arbitrator shall have
exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability,
enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>

<p><strong>e. Arbitration Costs.</strong> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be
governed by the AAA Rules. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’
fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you, unless the arbitrator determines
your claims were frivolous. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award
of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>f. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</strong> Except as provided in Section 15(c) above, the
arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by
either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual
party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that
party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public
injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of
prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and
extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in
arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall
be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>g. Severability.</strong></p>

<p><em>Summary: If a court decides a part of these Terms is unenforceable, the rest of these
Terms still apply.</em></p>

<p>With the exception of Section 14(b) “Class Action Waiver,” if an arbitrator or court of
competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable,
the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p>

<h2>16. General Terms.</h2>

<p><em>Summary: The following standard legal provisions are included to permit the Terms to function
as expected. For example, they provide that these Terms cover the entire agreement about Gems and
that you may not transfer your Account to anyone else.</em></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms (including the Gems Privacy Policy) cover the entire
        agreement between Gems and you about Gems. These Terms replace all prior agreements
        or understandings between Gems and you about Gems. If an arbitrator or court
        determines that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, we’ll enforce that
        part to the extent permissible and the other parts of these Terms will still be effective.</li>
    <li><strong>Notices.</strong> Gems will provide any notices by posting them in the App or on the Site or by
        sending other communications. You and Gems agree to communicate electronically.</li>
    <li><strong>Waiver.</strong> If Gems doesn’t enforce every right or provision in these Terms, we still have the
        right to enforce these rights and provisions in the future. Waivers must be written and
        signed by an authorized Gems representative to be effective. Exercising a right doesn’t
        impact other rights, unless specified otherwise in these Terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Both you and Gems will be treated equally when it comes to interpreting
        these Terms. For purposes of these Terms, the words “include,” “includes,” and
        “including” are meant to be followed by the words “without limitation.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>17. Contact Information.</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about these Terms or Gems, please contact Gems at
<a href="mailto:support@gems.xyz">support@gems.xyz</a>.</p>

<h2>18. Additional Rules.</h2>

<ul>
    <li>These rules will evolve over time as we continually work to cultivate a healthy and
        thriving community.</li>
    <li>If you come across a user, message, or service that appears to break these guidelines,
        please report it to us via in-app reporting flows or the in-app feedback form.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>i. Don’t use Gems to break the law or cause harm to others.</strong> For example, do not:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Praise or promote material from hate groups or U.S., Canadian, and E.U. proscribed terror groups</li>
    <li>Distribute child sexual abuse material</li>
    <li>Engage in human trafficking or sexual exploitation, including any attempt to distribute,
        participate or normalize child sexual abuse</li>
    <li>Trade in illegal goods or substances</li>
    <li>Steal or distribute others’ private personal information without their permission</li>
    <li>Hack or access systems that you aren’t authorized to access</li>
    <li>Scam or cheat others for financial gain</li>
    <li>Spam, phish, or otherwise use technical means to disrupt the experience of others on Gems</li>
    <li>Infringe other’s copyrights, trademarks and/or other intellectual property</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ii. Treat others with respect.</strong> For example, no:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Harassment or abuse directed at a specific person or group, including but not limited to, sexual
        harassment and gender identity-based harassment</li>
    <li>Promoting hate or extremist conduct that targets people or groups based on their race, gender,
        religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation</li>
    <li>Threats of violence or physical harm, or content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies violence
        against people, groups, or animals</li>
    <li>Encouraging self-harm or suicide</li>
    <li>Depictions of excessive violence, gore, torture, dismemberment, or non-consensual sexual activity</li>
    <li>Misleading impersonation of other individuals, organizations, or entities</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>iii. Follow the standards of the app or service you are visiting:</strong> Developers may establish
community guidelines for their own apps and services on the AT Protocol. Your failure to follow
those rules may result in your being restricted from using those apps.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting.</strong> We rely on the entire community (developers, creators, users, visitors) to
enforce our community guidelines.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User Violations of Gems Guidelines.</strong> You can report suspected violations of
        these Terms by reporting posts or accounts with the in-app reporting feature.
        Gems will review reports we receive against these Terms, and if we find a
        violation will take enforcement action, which may include restricting a user’s
        ability to use Gems. If your report relies on or relates to conduct that happened
        outside of Gems, please provide links, context, or any relevant evidence in the
        details section of your report, so our moderation team can take these factors into
        consideration.</li>
    <li><strong>Developer Violations of Gems Terms.</strong> To report an app or service that you
        believe is not complying with or enforcing the Gems Terms or Privacy Policy,
        please email Gems at <a href="mailto:support@gems.xyz">support@gems.xyz</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>App-Specific Guidelines.</strong> Developers of apps and operators of services may establish
their own standards of conduct, separate from the Terms. These services may temporarily or
permanently ban violators from their apps or services. To report violations of a
third-party app or service’s standard of conduct, please contact the developer or provider
of the third-party app or service. Gems cannot enforce the standards of conduct of
third-party apps or services.</p>

<p><strong>Gems Developer Guidelines</strong> Developers who federate their apps or services on the AT
Protocol must adhere to the Gems Developer Guidelines in order to communicate with Gems
services:</p>
<ul>

        Our definition of spam includes:
        <ul>
            <li>(a) Generating automated or bulk interactions, including any that would cause a notification to

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>All services must have a method for deleting content a user has requested to be deleted.</li>
    <li>Developers must have a system for appropriately responding to all user reports of
        violations within their apps.</li>
    <li>Developers must maintain updated contact information accessible to the public
        including an email address that is regularly monitored.</li>
    <li>Developers should maintain reasonable security measures to protect against
        unauthorized access or disclosure of any end-user information or app data.</li>

        and their responses, and Gems may at any time request such data to ensure
        compliance with its policies.</li>
